**Instructions**

1. Make sure you have python installed.
2. Import your data at the top-level directory and call it `data.csv`.
3. Ensure that there exists a header column with the label `frequency rating`.
4. Run `main.py`
5. There should now be a file called `sorted_data.csv` in the top-level directory that contains the sorted data by `frequency rating` in ascending order.
